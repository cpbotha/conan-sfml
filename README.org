sfml conanfile.py
Modification of https://github.com/TyRoXx/conan-sfml
by https://github.com/cpbotha to work on Mac

 * This uses the tarball instead of the zip file, as Python's zipfile
   library does not support symlinks, required on the Mac. See
   https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/336 for more details.
 * This also does some extra work to get the SFML dylibs and the
   included frameworks in the right place.
 * Furthermore, it works around the =hidden symbol __cpu_model= GCC 5
   and 6 bug on Ubuntu by patching the SFML linking configuration.

* On Mac, disable CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH

  On the Mac, the current conan 0.9.4 sets =CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=. If you
  want these sfml libraries to link correctly with your binary,
  comment out the =CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH= in your app's
  =conanbuildinfo.cmake=.

  See https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/337 for the whole
  story.
